Release Notes for KiCS2
=======================

Release notes for KiCS2 Version 0.2.4 (under development)
---------------------------------------------------------

Changes to version 0.2.3:

  * The installation process now uses `cabal`'s capabilities to install
    all required and locally generated Haskell packages into the installation
    directory, inside a new directory `pkg`.
    As a consequence, the installation process no longer depends on packages
    to be installed for the user.
    Furthermore, different versions of the KiCS2 compiler can now
    be installed in parallel, even when they are configured
    to use different versions of GHC.
  * Library `Prelude`: operations for encapsulated search omitted
    since the base primitive `try` is not implemented.
    Use libraries `AllSolutions`, `SearchTree`, and `SetFunctions`
    for encapsulated search.
  * Library `SearchTree`: operation `getAllValuesWith` added,
    operation `someValueBy` slightly changed and renamed to `someValueWith`.
  * Internal constructor in library FiniteMap changed.
    As a consequence, compiler intermediate (analysis) files produced
    by previous KiCS2 versions are incompatible to this version.
  * CASS tool (Curry Analysis Server System) added and integrated
    into currydoc.
  * Library `HTML`: default (white) background for body of generated
    web pages removed (since this is usually defined in css files).


Release notes for KiCS2 Version 0.2.3
-------------------------------------

Changes to version 0.2.2:

  * The KiCS2 REPL now supports the configuration of the user prompt
    via `:set prompt <prompt>`.

  * Syntax highlighting for KDE's editor component `katepart` added,
    supporting Curry and Literate Curry.

  * A frontend bug leading to an internal erroe when using as patterns
    inside functional patterns is fixed.

  * Some bugs regarding the combination of functional patterns and
    nonlinear left-hand-sides are fixed. The parser also accepts
    as-patterns inside functional patterns.

  * The GHC and cabal binaries used for installation can now be
    explicitly set. See the installation instructions for details.

  * Windows support for kernel installation.

    The KiCS2 kernel system (`kics2c`, `kics2`, `cleancurry`, `cymake`) can
    now be installed under Windows using MinGW. See the installation
    instructions for details.

  * Library module `Directory` updated and extended.

    - Replacement of `String` by `FilePath`
    - Added new function `createDirectoryIfMissing :: Bool -> FilePath -> IO ()`
    - Added new function `getHomeDirectory :: IO FilePath`
    - Added new function `getTemporaryDirectory :: IO FilePath`
    - Added new function `copyFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()`

  * Library `SetFunctions`: Operations `choose` and `select` added.

  * The front end accepts typed expressions of the form "Expr :: TypeExpr".
    Such type annotations are considered by the compiler.
    For instance, `(unknown :: Bool)` evaluates to `False` or `True`.

  * Library `FlatCurry` extended to represent typed expressions
    by a new constructor `Typed`.
